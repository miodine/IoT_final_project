NOTE: I WILL SEND YOU THE ENTIRE RASPBERRY PI VM IMAGE, THIS THING IS FOR SETUP ONLY, IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROTOTYPE YOUR CODE, AND 
NOT WORK ON THE REAL DATA - JUST DO THE POINTS 0. AND 1. FOR NOW! 

0. Do a backup of all the laboratory trash files that u might have in /home/pi/server/, then clean the folder xD
1. Place the folder 'IoT_scripts' in /home/pi/, and copy the contents of the 'server' folder into already existent /home/pi/server. 
See attached .png file to make sure that it looks like it should. Then you can access the resources with your usual VM IP, and reference
those directly xD


but if you want them to change, and u want that led matrix php script to work... 

2. Setting up the server script accessibility (the most painful part)

 Navigate to /home/pi/ directory in the terminal, then type:
chmod 777 -R IoT_scripts/
chmod 777 -R server/

in 'server' directory go:
chmod +x led_matrix.php
(and on that other one, with class - do it as well) 
in 'IoT_scripts' directory, go:
chmod +x update_measurements.py
(and other python files as well, if this wouldn't work for some reason)

NOTE: During the execution of either scripts - there also might be an error that some folder is not accessible - you'll get the path to the folder in the error,
just go 'chmod 777 -R /path/to/folder' on that folder.

You should have apropriate entry in the sudoers.d folder marked already, but if not - check the `other` attached image and make 
sure that the contents of the apropriate files are the same as presented (like with vim or regular notpad - check the commands)

3. Run the 'update_measurements.py' scripts, either with ./update_measurements.py or python3 update_measurements.py
4. ???
5. Profit.
