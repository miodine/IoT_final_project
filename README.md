## About
The following document presents overview of the system assembled for the final task of Mobile and embedded applications for Internet of Things laboratory class.

## Specification and description
The system allows to retrieve basic measurement data and user-data, the system has three required GUIs, allowing for data visualisation in the required forms 
(dynamic listings, time charts, with appropriate units). The sample time does not exceed 1000ms, the client application can control all the output actuators, 
and allow for change in system settings. 

The IoT system is based on the Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat shield. In the implementation, we were unable to assemble the physical system,
therefore the virtual machine with SenseHat emulator has been used. In accordance with the specification, we prepared the server, and mobile clients,
whose specifics are listed in the following subsections, whereas the overall structure is presented in the figure below:
